The recipe documentation is currently being reworked with Sphinx in
the ``doc`` subdirectory of this project.

It is built continuously and uploaded to
http://docs.anybox.fr/anybox.recipe.openerp/trunk by Anybox' public
buildbot.

We plan to upload that http://pythonhosted.org

The previous single-file ``README.rst`` has been kept as
`doc/reference.rst <http://docs.anybox.fr/anybox.recipe.openerp/trunk/doc/old_readme.html>_`
